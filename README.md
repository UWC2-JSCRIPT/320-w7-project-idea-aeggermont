# Project Idea: An Interactiuve Professional Portfolio developed in ReactJS


## Elevator Pitch

* I am a software developer and a UX engineer. An important aspect of my career development as a technologist designer is to explore different project opportunities by showcasing my skills with different teams at my company and  beyond. So hiring managers, and other designer and engineers will be the users of this app. THe value the users will gain is to have a solid and clear understanding of my skill set, potential, and the projects I have developed and contrubuted.


* I elected to use a Firebase database to store the contents of the portfolio to be able to update the different pages and my own profile without having to do deploy the ReactJS app. In addition, I plan to host the ReactJS app in Firebase as well.  Features like function base components, project recommendations, and basic analytics to find out what features and pages are being viewed are part of my final project.

* Since the beginning of the course I have been developing this portfolio by using the skills and knowledge I have been gaining from the course lectures and the assignments. So a substantial amount of work in base UI has been done towards building this app.  However, all data content is currently card-coded, and the recommender project feature have not been implemented. So the final project will consist on enhancing the current MVP I have developed using Firebase for content management and hosting. 




## Assignment Requirements

Above are the requirements for the project. For this week however, you'll need to create a plan for your project. More details are to come, but you'll need to create a pull request with the following:

* The name of your project
* An elevator pitch (a paragraph about what your project does). Be sure to address:
  * Who will use your project
  * The value that your project will provide to the end user
* [Wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) to help visualize what your project will look like
  * These wireframes do not have to be high-fidelity. You're free to use boxes, hand drawings, tools such as Draw.io, etc.
* A list of dependencies you'll be using for your project (npm modules, APIs, Firebase, etc.)
  * This list will likely change as you work on your project, but listing your dependencies will help you visualize the complexity of the project
* A list of tasks that need to be completed for your project
  * Example list of tasks for the Star Wars films example:
    * Setup `create-react-app` scaffold
    * Call the Star Wars API and print results
    * Store API results in React component state
    * Render React state
* A plan for the next 3 weeks and what you plan to accomplish each week

## Recommendations

* Keep the scope of your project small. A small, completed project is much better than a large, incomplete project. You can create a list of "nice to have" features that you can work on if you have time (similar to how our assignments have a main list of requirements and "bonus" items).
* Ensure you have plenty of buffer time in your schedule. Life events pop up, and tasks can take longer than initially estimated.

## Submitting your Project Idea

1. Add your project name, elevator pitch, wireframes, dependencies, task list, and plan to the GitHub repo (you can add a markdown file + images or links to images)
2. Create a pull request
3. Create a zip file of your repo for submission to Canvas.
